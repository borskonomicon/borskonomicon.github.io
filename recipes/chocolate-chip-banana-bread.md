A moist, bakery-style banana bread studded with chocolate chips. Browning the butter deepens the flavor while sour cream keeps the crumb tender.

- **Yield:** 1 (9×5-inch) loaf
- **Prep time:** 20 minutes
- **Bake time:** 55–65 minutes

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup (113 g) unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup (110 g) packed light brown sugar
- 2 large eggs, room temperature
- 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup (120 g) sour cream, room temperature
- 1 1/2 cups (360 g) mashed very ripe bananas (about 3–4 medium)
- 1 3/4 cups (230 g) all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1 cup (170 g) semisweet or dark chocolate chips, plus 1/2 cup (85 g) for topping

## Instructions
1. Heat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan and line it with a parchment sling that overhangs the long sides.
2. Brown the butter: melt the butter in a light-colored saucepan over medium heat, swirling often, until the milk solids turn amber and the butter smells nutty, 4–6 minutes. Pour into a large mixing bowl and cool until warm but not hot.
3. Whisk the granulated sugar and brown sugar into the browned butter until combined. Whisk in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla.
4. Whisk in the sour cream until smooth, then stir in the mashed bananas.
5. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Add the dry mixture to the wet ingredients and fold with a spatula until a few streaks of flour remain.
6. Fold in 1 cup (170 g) of chocolate chips until evenly distributed.
7. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smooth the top, and scatter the remaining 1/2 cup (85 g) of chocolate chips over the surface.
8. Bake for 55–65 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs (avoid melted chocolate when testing). If the top is browning too quickly, tent loosely with foil during the last 10–15 minutes.
9. Cool the loaf in the pan for 20 minutes, then use the parchment to lift it out to a wire rack. Let cool until barely warm before slicing for the cleanest pieces.

## Notes
- For the best texture, use very ripe bananas with plenty of brown spots.
- Room-temperature dairy helps the batter emulsify smoothly; let the sour cream and eggs sit out for 15–20 minutes before mixing.
- The loaf keeps well wrapped at room temperature for up to 3 days; for longer storage, wrap slices tightly and freeze for up to 2 months.
