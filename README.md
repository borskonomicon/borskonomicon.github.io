# Borskonomicon Recipes

This repository collects family-favorite recipes from around the internet so they remain easy to find and survive link rot. Each recipe is vendored with full ingredients and instructions so it can be reproduced even if the source site disappears. When possible, the original source link is noted to give credit and allow deeper reading.

## Repository layout
- `recipes/` — individual recipe files in Markdown, each including ingredients, instructions, yield, and notes.
- `config.toml` — reserved for future site-generation settings.

## Adding a recipe
1. Create a new Markdown file inside `recipes/` named for the dish (e.g., `chocolate-chip-banana-bread.md`).
2. Include the recipe title, source link, yield, prep/bake times if available, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.
3. Preserve ingredient amounts exactly and keep instructions clear so the recipe remains faithfully reproducible.
4. Commit the change and track the source in the file so future updates can cross-reference the original.
