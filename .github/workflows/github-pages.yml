    # Build and deploy are kept as separate jobs because GitHub Pages expects
    # the published artifact to come from an uploaded bundle rather than from a
    # workspace that runs with elevated deploy permissions. This pattern limits
    # the scope of the deploy token, makes it clear what files are deployed, and
    # mirrors the configuration recommended in the Pages documentation.
