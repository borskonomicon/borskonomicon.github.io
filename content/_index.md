Welcome! This site preserves the recipes my family keeps cooking even when their original sources vanish. Each entry includes the full ingredient list, step-by-step instructions, and a link back to the cook or publication that inspired it.

Use the search below to jump into a dish, or browse the catalog to explore what is already archived. More recipes will be added over time as I backfill favorites and test new finds.
