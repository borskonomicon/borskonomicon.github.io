A moist, bakery-style banana bread loaded with mashed bananas and chocolate chips.

- **Yield:** 1 (9×5-inch) loaf
- **Prep time:** 15 minutes
- **Bake time:** 60–75 minutes

## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups (380 g) ripe mashed banana, measured (3–4 medium)
- 1/2 cup (100 g) packed light brown sugar
- 1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup (110 g) unsalted butter, melted
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup (130 g) 2% Greek yogurt (or sour cream)
- 1 1/3 cups (180 g) all-purpose flour or 1-to-1 gluten-free baking flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon fine salt
- 3/4 cup (140 g) mini chocolate chips, plus a handful for topping

## Instructions
1. Heat the oven to 325°F (165°C). Grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan and line it with parchment.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
3. In a separate bowl, mix the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until the mixture looks paste-like.
4. Whisk in the mashed bananas, then the eggs, yogurt, and vanilla until smooth.
5. Fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients just until combined, then fold in the chocolate chips.
6. Pour the batter into the pan and spread it evenly. Sprinkle a handful of extra chocolate chips on top if desired.
7. Bake for 60–75 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs (avoid melted chocolate when checking). Cool completely before slicing.

## Notes
- For the best texture, use very ripe bananas with plenty of brown spots and measure the mash to 1 1/2 cups.
- Sour cream can be swapped for the Greek yogurt in equal amounts.
